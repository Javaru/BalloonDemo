# BalloonDemo

Simple IntelliJ IDEA plugin to open two notification balloons to demonstrate an issue with the order in which the balloons are closed.

1. Open a large balloon via the menu: *Tools > EXAMPLE Notifications > Show Large Balloon*
2. Open a small balloon via the menu: *Tools > EXAMPLE Notifications > Show Small Balloon*
3. Attempt to close the small top balloon. The lower balloon closes instead.
